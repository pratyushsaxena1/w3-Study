	    <p id = 'guidep1p'><strong>Website Purpose:</strong> The purpose of w3-Study is to serve as a tool for TJ students to study together in an organized fashion. Instead of studying only with friends, you can meet new people and study with them. This can help you improve your productivity, make friends, and get to know the TJ community a little bit better. Using w3-Study can also help you make your meetings more organized so you never miss out on a study session.</p>
